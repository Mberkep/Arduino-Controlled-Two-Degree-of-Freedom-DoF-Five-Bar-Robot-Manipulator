In this research, we construct a arduino-controlled two-degree-of-freedom (DoF) ﬁve-bar robot manipulator. To control the manipulator, we use arduino program aŌer compleƟng the inverse kinemaƟc analysis of the robot manipulator.We determine link lengths using inverse kinemaƟc results.Using the results of the inverse kinemaƟcs, the program accurately calculates the joint variables necessary for posiƟoning the end-eﬀector at speciﬁed coordinates.  First of all, the link lengths were determined. Then the inverse kinemaƟcs of the 5 bar were made. Then the end eﬀector moves linearly in y direcƟon. We achieved this linear rotaƟon by giving equal volts to the motors in opposiƟon to each other with the help of Arduino. Then we designed and produced the links and joints.
