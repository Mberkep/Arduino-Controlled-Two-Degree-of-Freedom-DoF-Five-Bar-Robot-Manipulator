In this research, we construct a arduino-controlled two-degree-of-freedom (DoF) five-bar robot manipulator. To control the manipulator, we use arduino program after completing the inverse kinematic analysis of the robot manipulator. We determine link lengths using inverse kinematic results. Using the results of the inverse kinematics, the program accurately calculates the joint variables necessary for positioning the end-effector at specified coordinates. First of all, the link lengths were determined. Then the inverse kinematics of the 5 bar were made. Then the end effector moves linearly in y direction. We achieved this linear rotation by giving equal volts to the motors in opposition to each other with the help of Arduino. Then we designed and produced the links and joints
